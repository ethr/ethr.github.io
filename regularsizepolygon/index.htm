<p>This form will be processed to give you the area of a n-sided polygon with 
  any (P)erimeter.</p>
<p>You could call this cheating, however, since the numbers will give the same 
  result, this just takes out the calculating (which you would do on calculator 
  anyway)</p>
<p>as long as you present it correctly this is nothing more than a calculator 
  which does serval sums at once.</p>
<form action="working.php" method="post" name="n-sided" id="n-sided">
  <p>!) Enter the number of sides (n) 
    <input name="n" type="text" id="n" value="number of sides">
  </p>
  <p>2) Enter the perimeter of ths shape i.e. 1000 
    <input name="p" type="text" id="p" value="1000">
  </p>
  <p> 
    <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit">
    <input type="reset" name="Submit2" value="Reset">
