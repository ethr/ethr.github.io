This page contains some links to various demonstrations and tests of
varying quality that I've put together over the years for my own
learning.

## [Jet Rider](/babylonjs/jetrider/)
WebGL/JavaScript game using BabylonJS framework and assets found on
the internet for free. Was a good excuse to try out BabylonJS. Code
can be found [on github](https://github.com/ethr/jetrider).

## [JS Chess](/jschess)
Chess Board in JavaScript with move validation. Probably the one of
the first things I programmed in JavaScript when I started University.

<!--
## [Regular Sized Polygon](/regularsizepolygon)
Pretty much the first program I ever wrote, aged 14. Its a simple PHP
script for automatically calculating the area of an N sided polygon
which I was required to do as part of a school assignment and got fed
up of doing by hand.
