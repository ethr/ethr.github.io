title: Arbitary Moments
---

After coming across the [RunningStats](http://www.johndcook.com/skewness_kurtosis.html) code by John
Cook, I wanted to understand the theory behind the code. This lead be to a paper by
[Pebay](http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2008/086212.pdf)
which showed how arbitrary moments could be calculated for data.
However, the proof included a step I didn't follow so I wrote a document based
on my notes which includes the missing steps.
