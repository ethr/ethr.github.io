I'm a massive Vim user and often looking for ways to improve my editing experience. Here's some things I've found recently:

[Inconsolata Font](http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html)
This is a really clear font that renders nicely on Windows/GVIM. It looks a little like the Monaco font but renders so much better.


[GitHub theme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2855)
Really clear light theme based on git hub's code editor.


### [NERDtree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658)
I put off using this plugin for a while but it is very good as it keeps a file explorer open next to your editing area.
